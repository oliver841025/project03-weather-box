# weather_box_2

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/chinghsuan/pen/VwvJgjB](https://codepen.io/chinghsuan/pen/VwvJgjB).

The third project i made and based on the app 'weather box' on the cellphone.

What i've learned in this project:

1. svg as a part of animation
2. hover to make some interactions
3. keyframes to let the source moved as i thought
